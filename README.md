## uca-phantom

[libuca](https://github.com/ufo-kit/libuca) plugin for the Vision Research
Phantom high-speed cameras.


### Testing with the mock software emulation

Go to the `utils` directory and start the UDP discovery and TCP communication
servers by running the `mock` script. The `phantom` plugin should be able to
communicate with this replacement.
